# getting-cleaning-data
This repo contains three files.
1. run_analysis.R
2. README.md
3. codebook.md

To perform analysis.
1. download the data from 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip. You can find the full description at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
2. load the unzipped data to your working directory. 
3. following the instruction in the code, and run the R code.
4. After the code finish running (It might take awhile), you will find two files
  generated in the same directory. The first is meanAndStd which contains the 
  mean and standard deviation variables for each measurement. The second is 
  called meanData which contains the average of each variable for each activity 
  and each subject.
